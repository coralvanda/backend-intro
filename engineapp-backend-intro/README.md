Multi-user blog page

What is it?
-----------
This is a project created for the Udacity Full-Stack Developer Nanodegree program.  A user may register on the site, and then make blog posts which will be displayed.  A number of other functions are available at slightly modified URLs based on previous lessons from the course, and they may be ignored.

How to use
----------
Open https://engineapp-backend-intro.appspot.com/ with a webbrowser and create an account to access all features.

Note on DB vs NDB
-----------------
Although the course made use of Google's DB system to create this code, users will find that the code has been modified to use the more current NDB system instead.
